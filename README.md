# ADNLogin-SDK-iOS

This is the documentation for the App.net Login SDK for iOS. It allows users to forgo entering passwords into each app and instead authorize from the App.net Passport iOS application. This app will allow you to browse the App.net directory and perform account management functions.

## Usage

The SDK is designed to have no other dependencies other than iOS itself. It should work with iOS 5.1+, though use of a modern SDK with ARC and "modern" object literal support is required. (If this is a problem for anyone, we can likely change this.)

Your app will need to define a specific URL scheme in its Info.plist file which will identify it to the login SDK. The "Identifier" of this URL scheme must be set up in a specific way. Here is an example:

Should be entered into the URL scheme editor this way:

Multiple apps which share the same App.net client ID but which are represented by different applications in the iOS app store should suffix the designated URL scheme for alternate versions with an app-unique identifier, e.g., "ipad" for the iPad version of an application. This suffix should match with the information entered in the app management interface on App.net.

In your app delegate's header file, import ADNLogin.h, have your delegate implement the ADNLoginDelegate protocol, and add a property to hold onto the ADNLogin object.

```objc
#import "ADNLogin.h"

@interface SLAppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate, ADNLoginDelegate>

@property (strong, nonatomic) ADNLogin *adn;

...

@end
```

In your app delegate's .m file, instantiate the SDK:

```objc
@implementation SLAppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
	self.adn = [[ADNLogin alloc] init];
	self.adn.delegate = self;

...
```

Ensure that the login SDK has the opportunity to handle any open URL which comes back:

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
    return [self.adn openURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];
 }
```

Implement the ADNLoginDelegate protocol methods:

```objc
#pragma mark - ADNLoginDelegate

- (void)adnLoginDidSucceedForUserWithID:(NSString *)userID token:(NSString *)accessToken {
    // ... do some stuff
}

- (void)adnLoginDidFailWithError:(NSError *)error {
    // ... and here too
}
```

### With Blocks

Another method to just get the login information without having to manage anything and using blocks is just to use this function

```objc
[ADNLogin loginWithScopes:(NSArray *)scopes completion:(void(^)(NSString *userId, NSString *accessToken, NSError *error))aCompletion{
    if(error){
        // Error handling here
    }
    else{
        // Success case here
    }
}];
```

Keep in mind that the login SDK still needs to have the opportunity to handle any open URL which comes back:

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
    return [ADNLogin openActiveSessionURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];
 }
```

### Credential Storage

Credential storage is currently out of scope of the SDK. Please be sure to store credentials securely, i.e., in the Keychain as opposed to being stashed in NSUserDefaults. We suggest [SSKeychain](https://github.com/soffes/sskeychain) for this purpose.

Of course, please feel free to deviate from these directions if you know what you're doing. ;) Everyone has their own habits and preferences when it comes to code -- and that seems to be especially true for ObjC.

Feedback welcome.
